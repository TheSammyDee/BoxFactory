Box Factory is a logic based puzzle game.

The goal is to recreate the configuration of stamps on the box shown, in the fewest number of moves. There are three commands that can be applied to a box: rotating the box 90 degrees on the Y axis, rotating 90 degrees on the Z axis, or applying a stamp to the current face of the box. Players use their 3D visualization skills to work out the correct rotations to apply to the box to correctly place the stamps. Only after inputting all commands can the player apply the commands and check their answer.

Download the project and open in Unity 2017.3.1.p.2 or later to play in the Unity editor, or build to Android from Unity to play on your Android device. (Only tested on a Moto G5+)
